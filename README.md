    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">Published: August 12, 2025 | Source: Renewables Now | <a href="https://renewablesnow.com/news/renalfa-ipp-switches-on-1st-phase-of-238-mw-solar-project-in-bulgaria-1280017/" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: none;">Read Original</a></p>

    <p><strong>Country/Region:</strong> Bulgaria — <strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Renalfa IPP, ESO, Bulgarian energy authorities.</p>
    <p>Renalfa IPP switched on the first 69 MW of its 238-MW Tenevo solar park and connected it to Bulgaria’s 400-kV transmission network. The project is designed as a hybrid plant pairing PV with large-scale storage to firm output and support grid stability. </p>
    <p>The full site will include a 315-MW/760-MWh battery system now underway, with the second solar phase due in early 2026. Renalfa positions Tenevo as a flagship asset for merchant/PPA revenues in Bulgaria’s increasingly storage-enabled solar market. </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source reliability this week:</strong> Very strong on Renewables Now, Balkan Green Energy News, Portfolio.hu and Romania-Insider; SeeNews provided timely MK statistics. CfD outcomes in Romania were covered consistently across outlets. </li>
    <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> Clear acceleration of battery storage in Bulgaria (multiple gigawatt-hours in pipeline) and Romania’s shift to hybridisation (wind+solar, solar+storage). Hungary focused on renewable heat certificates and geothermal funding. </li>
    <li><strong>Emerging trends:</strong> Negative pricing across Europe is pushing storage, demand response and hybrid projects; Romania’s CfD framework is maturing but wind still faces allocation headwinds. </li>
    <li><strong>Automation ideas:</strong> 1) Scraper to auto-ingest CfD and tender results into a structured database (date, MW, technology, bidder). 2) Link-checker with date filter to enforce the 7–14 day window. 3) Keyword/NER pipeline to auto-populate “Stakeholders” fields for each entry.</li>

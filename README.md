  <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> BESS, Capacity, Grid Balancing, Solar Integration</p>
  <p><strong>Country/Region:</strong> Bulgaria — <strong>Stakeholders:</strong> ESO, private storage developers, BNR.</p>
  <p>Operational battery capacity in Bulgaria has reached about 500 MW (≈1,300 MWh), with ESO indicating storage will play a larger role as PV approaches 5.5 GW installed. The current fleet already helps shift daytime solar into evening demand peaks. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
  <p>New interconnection requests signal a steep build-out trajectory for storage, aligning with a wave of project financing and orders for utility-scale systems. Market participants expect improving ancillary-services revenues as balancing needs grow. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>

  <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> BESS Pipeline, Grid Connection, System Operator</p>
  <p><strong>Country/Region:</strong> Bulgaria — <strong>Stakeholders:</strong> ESO, Ministry of Energy, APSTE.</p>
  <p>ESO’s chief said developers have filed for ~12 GW / 35 GWh of storage connections and that 7,000–10,000 MWh could be installed in the coming months, significantly boosting flexibility. Authorities are also preparing a call for EUR 120m in state aid for 1.5 GWh of storage. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
  <p>Industry groups welcome the momentum but warn high fees on solar and batteries could hamper the pace of price-lowering investments. The storage uptick follows strong PV additions and a revised balancing methodology that has improved system discipline. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>

  <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Prosumers, Rooftop Solar, Permitting Reform</p>
  <p><strong>Country/Region:</strong> North Macedonia — <strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Ministry of Energy, DSO, Parliament.</p>
  <p>Draft legal changes would lift rooftop PV thresholds to 10 kW for households and 70 kW for businesses and introduce one-month deadlines for permitting and grid connection up to 100 kW. The reform also mandates solar thermal collectors in new or substantially renovated public buildings where feasible. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p>
  <p>Officials frame the move as a prosumer acceleration package aimed at cutting queues, standardising processes and easing energy community deployment, while ensuring DSOs respond quickly or propose alternative connection points. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>
